The Sparks Foundation mission is to inspire students, help them innovate, and let them integrate to build the next generation humankind. To inspire, motivate, and encourage students to learn, create, and help build a better society. To teach new ways of thinking, to innovate and solve the problems on their own. We help the students to integrate and help each other, learn from each other, and do well together.

Their Vision Statement : A world of enabled and connected little minds, building future. Our Mission Statement To inspire students, help them innovate and let them integrate to build the next generation humankind.

# TASKS

## TASK 1: Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning

### Objective:
Predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours. What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

### About the task:
This task is Supervised Machine Learning(ML) and such kind of learning includes the training of the model on a labelled dataset that includes both training and validation of datasets. The Labelled dataset is one that has both input and output parameters.

## TASK 2: Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

### Objective:
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually this task is an Unsupervised Machine Learning 

## TASK 6: Implementing a Decision Tree Classifier and Visualizing it graphically

### Objective:
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, building a decision tree classifier to predict the new data to the right class.
